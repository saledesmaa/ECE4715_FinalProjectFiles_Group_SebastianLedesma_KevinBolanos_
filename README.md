In this project, we created an image recognition model using TensorFlow and Keras. TensorFlow is a robust deep learning framework, and Keras is a high-level API (Application Programming Interface) that provides a modular, easy-to-use, and organized interface to solve real-life deep learning problems. This code was devloped within the Spyder programming IDE in the Python Language alongside a custom environment to support the necessary libraries.
